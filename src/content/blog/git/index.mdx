1. What is git?
- Git is a distributed version control system designed to track changes in files and coordinate work among multiple contributors.
- it is used to manage source code, track project history, facilitae collaboration, and enable branching and merging workflows.

2. what is the difference between git and github?
- Git is the version control system, while Github is a hosting platform for git repositories.
- github provides additional features such as collaboration tools, issue tracking, pull requests, integration with other applications.

3. What is repository in Git?
- A repository in git is a collection of files and directories along with the version gistory of those files.
- it represents a project and serves as the central location for storing, managing and sharing code.

4. How do you create a new git repository?
- `git init` initializes a new git repository in the current directory, creating a `.git` folder to store version control metadata.

5. Explain the difference between a git commit and a git push?
- `git commit` records changes to the repository's files, creating a new snapshot or version of the project.
- `git push` on the other hands, sends committed changes from a local repository to a remote repository, enabling collaboration and sharing of code with others.

6. What is git branch?
- Git branch is a lightweight movable pointer to a commit in the repository's version history.
- branches are used to isolate work on new features, bug fixes or experiments without affecting the main codebase.

7. How to create and switch between branches?
- to create a new branch `git branch branch-name`
- to switch to new branch `git checkout branch-name` or `git switch branch-name`
- create and switch in one step `git checkout -b branch-name` or `git switch -c branch-name`

8. What is a Git merge?
- a git merge combines changes from one branch into another branch
- it integrates the changes made in the source branch (feature) into the target branch (main) by creating a new merge commit that incorporates both sets of changes.

9. What is a Git pull request?
- A git pull request is a mechanism for proposing changes and initiating code review in a collaborative development workflow.
- it allows contributors to request that their changes be reviewed, disscussed and eventually merged into the target branch by project maintainers.

10. What is git Fork?
- Git fork is a copy of a repository that allows users t ofreely experiment with changes withou affecting the original repository.

11. What are git tags?
- git tags are references to specific points in a repository's version history.
- typically used to mark version or release number

12. How do you revert a commit in git?
- `git revert commit-id`
- this creates a new commit that undoes the changes introduced in specified commit id

13. Explain the concept of Git remote and remote repository?
- git remote is a refrence to a remote reposity, typically hosted on a server like github, gitlab or bitbucket
- it acts as a refrence to remote repo

14. How do you resolve merge conflicts in git?
- merge conflicts occur when git cannot automatically merge changes from different branches.
- to fix this , we manually edit the conflicting files to resolve conflicts, mark them as resolved using git add, and commit the changes
- after that run `git merge --continue` to finally merge.

15. What is git rebase and when it is used?
- git rebase is a command used to reapply commits on top of another base commit.
- it is commonly used to integrate changes from one branch onto another while maintaning a linear commit history.
- rebase should be used to keep commit history clean and avoid unnecessary merge commits in feature branches.

16. What is the difference between git pull, fetch, clone, push, remote ?
- GIT CLONE - it copies the whole project with all the commit history and add setup the remote origin.
- GIT PULL - To fetch the latest changes from the remote and automatically merge them into your current branch.
- GIT FETCH - to fetch new commits and branches from the remote but without merging them into local branch  
- GIT PUSH - uploads our local commits to the remote repository
- GIT REMOTE - manage connection to our remote repository

17. what is the difference between git diff and git status?
- GIT STATUS - tells what has changed in your working directory and staging area
- GIT DIFF - shows the exact line-by-line changes made to tracked files that are not staged 

18. what is the difference between git merge and git rebase?
- GIT COMMIT - combines two branches by creating a new commit
- GIT REBASE - 


19. what is the use of staging area or indexing in git?
- The staging area (also known as the index) is an intermediate zone where you can prepare changes before committing them to the repository.

20. what does the command git cofig does?
- the `git config` command is used to view and set configuration options for git 
- example 
```bash
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email "john@example.com"

```

21. what does git cherry-pick command do?
- `git cherry-pick` is used to apply the changes from a specific commit from one branch onto your current branch without merging the entire branch.
- `git cherry-pick commithash`

22. what is the difference between git revert and git reset?
- Both git revert and git reset are used to undo changes in Git — but they work very differently
- `git revert commithash` adds a new commit that inverts the changes made by the original commit.
- `git reset [--soft | mixed | hard] commit-hash` move the head to a previous commit
 ```bash
--soft = undo commit but keep changes staged
--mixed = unstage changes, keep local edits
--hard = rase commits and local changes
 ```

23. what do you mean by head in term of git and also tell the number of heads that can be present in a repository?
`HEAD` is a refrence to the current snapshot of your working directory. it usually points to the latest commit on the current branch you are working on.
- if you are on `main`, then `HEAD` points to `refs/heads/main`
- a Git repository has only one `HEAD` at a time
- However, you can have multiple branches, and each branch has its own tip — but these are not `HEAD`s.

24. Can you recover a deleted branch in git?
- Yes, we can recover a deleted branch in Git, as long as the commits haven't been garbage collected yet.
- Git doesn't immediately delete the commits — instead, it simply removes the branch reference.
- The underlying commits still exist in Git’s database until they're garbage collected (which usually happens after ~30 days by default).

25. How to see commit history in git?
- `git log` is used to see logs in git 
- useful options to combine with
