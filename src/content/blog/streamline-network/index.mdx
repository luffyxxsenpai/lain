Networking on Linux can get confusing because there are many different tools to manage it. Tools like **ifupdown**, **NetworkManager**, and **systemd-networkd** can all be used — but mixing them can create conflicts.

since i am setting up debian 12 as my base OS for my homelab cause ubuntu is a bloat, we will clean up the networking setup on **Debian** and configure it properly using **systemd-networkd** for managing the network and **systemd-resolved** for DNS. This keeps everything simple and easy to troubleshoot.

---

## Understanding How Different Systems Work

Before we get started, let's clear up how different distros handle networking:

### Ubuntu Server & Ubuntu AMI (Cloud)

* Uses **netplan** with **systemd-netwrokd**, Netplan generates the required config in `/etc/netplan/50_cloudinit.yaml.` which can be used by systemd-networkd.
    

### Most Linux Desktop

* Uses **NetworkManager** by default.
    

### Debian

* Offers options like:
    
    * **ifupdown** (older method)
        
    * **NetworkManager**
        
    * **systemd-networkd** (modern, lightweight)
        

We will go with **systemd-networkd** because it's simple, clean, and good for servers or homelabs.

---

## Step 1: Install Required Tools

Most likely, **systemd-networkd** is already installed on Debian, but to be sure:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install systemd-networkd systemd-resolved -y
```

---

## Step 2: Remove Unnecessary Tools

First, let's get rid of any tools we don't need:

```bash
sudo apt remove --purge ifupdown network-manager net-tools -y
sudo apt autoremove --purge -y
```

check if any leftover packages remain:

```bash
dpkg -l | grep -E 'ifupdown|network-manager'
```

If you see anything, purge it.

---

## Step 3: Enable systemd-networkd and systemd-resolved

```bash
sudo systemctl enable systemd-networkd --now
sudo systemctl enable systemd-resolved --now
```

Check if they're running:

```bash
systemctl status systemd-networkd
systemctl status systemd-resolved
```

**Tip:** To properly use `resolvectl`, make sure `/etc/resolv.conf` points to systemd's resolver:

```bash
sudo ln -sf /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf
```

---

## Step 4: Configure the Network

All configs for **systemd-networkd** live in `/etc/systemd/network/`.

### 4.1 DHCP Example (Automatic IP)

Create a file like [`10-ethernet.network`](http://10-ethernet.network):

```bash
sudo nvim /etc/systemd/network/10-ethernet.network
```

```ini
[Match]
Name=enp1s0f1  # Change this to your interface name

[Network]
DHCP=yes
```

### 4.2 Static IP Example

```ini
[Match]
Name=enp1s0f1

[Network]
Address=192.168.1.50/24
Gateway=192.168.1.1
DNS=1.1.1.1
```

After creating the config, reload:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart systemd-networkd
```

---

## Step 5: Basic Troubleshooting & Commands

### 5.1 Check Link Status

```bash
networkctl status enp1s0f1
```

### 5.2 Show IP Addresses

```bash
ip a
```

### 5.3 Show Routes

```bash
ip route show
```

### 5.4 DNS Status

```bash
resolvectl status
```

### 5.5 Test Connectivity

```bash
ping 8.8.8.8
ping google.com
```

# Managing DNS with `systemd-resolved` on Debian

Since we are now using **systemd-resolved**, our `/etc/resolv.conf` is a symlink managed by `systemd`. So, we don't edit it manually. Instead, we manage DNS settings properly using tools and configuration files.

---

## ✅ Temporary DNS Change

This change is temporary and will reset After a system reboot or After restarting systemd-networkd

### Command:

```bash
resolvectl dns <interface> <dns-address>
```

Example:

```plaintext
resolvectl dns enp1s0f1 1.1.1.1
```

To Verify:

```plaintext
resolvectl status
```

## ✅ Permanent DNS Change

To set DNS permanently, edit your .network configuration file inside /etc/systemd/network/[xyz.network](http://xyz.network)

Example of Static IP + DNS:

```ini
[Match]
Name=enp1s0f1

[Network]
Address=192.168.1.50/24
Gateway=192.168.1.1
DNS=1.1.1.1
```

Apply the changes:

`sudo systemctl restart systemd-networkd`

## ✅ Using DHCP but Custom DNS (Ignore Router DNS)

Even when using DHCP for automatic IP configuration, you can override the DNS provided by your router.

```ini
[Match]
Name=enp1s0f1

[Network]
DHCP=yes
DNS=1.1.1.1
```

Apply the changes: `sudo systemctl restart systemd-networkd`

> so now to manage DNS, temporary way is using resolvectl dns &lt;interface\_name&gt; 1.1.1.1 , but to make it permanent we can simply edit our network file `/etc/systemd/network/`[`10-wired.network`](http://10-wired.network) file and define dns or other paramethers directly and simply restarat systemd-networkd
