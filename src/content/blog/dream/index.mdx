### the moment
so it starts with me being stressed out since its morning and i just found i have math exam ffs and i know nothing so after a stressfull moment i decide not to give this time and will do later 
and then i am walking with some girl but we have some argument or pissed off so i am too ahead of her and she is folllowing me with a lunchbox and we reach a park and she is there with some school kids and i am near some tree looking at horizon and shit and so after that we decide to go to our hanging spot a room somewhere i have , 2 guys are already there idk they are frnds ig or frnd frnd but yeah so they 2 on bed and now me and her also on bed now i gotta smoke so i get up and i am smoking looking at her but one of the guy starts shit he starts to act like he is in sleep and putting his legs on her and all i am watching it fullly pissed and just waiting when she will start first and when she do things go brutal i beat the shit oout of both of them like brutal shit and then its night we are low since police finding us my dad is on phone call screaming like it would be those 2 guys fault cursing them, and then here comes the best part 

we are now again in same room, she has a black tanktop and ofc a thin blanket and i am laying next to her we have a window in room so we are looking at the red dusk sunset and all and then i look at her, she is LOOKING at me like you  can tell she is gazing beyond my soul and her eyes just filled with love you can say. i kiss her and smile and she looks happy and then i hug her and start kissing and oh god i could feel this peace in my heart beyond the barrier of dreams it was so peaceful this moment it was like yeah a real dreeam for me and then my brain sensed it and like na na na bsdk you do not get this shit and i woke up i was in this shit state like fk i could still feel taht love for a moment before going full crashout 
that moment was a small moment but the BEST i would make a deal with mafisto for this , i was really like yeah happy and complete as a soul when i looked at her eyes as we kissed
